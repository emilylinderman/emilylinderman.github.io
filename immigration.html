<h1>Immigration in the United States</h1>
<h2>by Emily Linderman</h2>
  <p><b>Lawful permanent residents</b>, also known as “green card” holders, are non-citizens who are lawfully authorized to live permanently within the United States.</p>
  <p>A <b>refugee</b> is a person outside his or her country of nationality who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her country of nationality because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</p>
  <p><b>Naturalization</b> confers U.S. citizenship upon foreign nationals who have fulfilled the requirements Congress established in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). After naturalization, foreign-born citizens enjoy nearly all of the same benefits, rights, and responsibilities that the Constitution gives to native-born U.S. citizens, including the right to vote.</p>
